To make this script run:
* you must download the chromedriver
* configure a ifttt account to create custom notification on your device ( webhook => notification)

The script will try to find a button to add to cart, and then send a notif if it succeeds, pretty basic. 
The idea is to make it the simpler to run the faster

```shell
python main.py
```
